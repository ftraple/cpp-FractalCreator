The Mandelbrot set is generated by iteration, which means to repeat a process over and over again. In mathematics this process is most often the application of a mathematical function. For the Mandelbrot set, the functions involved are some of the simplest imaginable: they all are what is called quadratic polynomials and have the form f(x) = xÂ² + c, where c is a constant number. As we go along, we will specify exactly what value c takes.
